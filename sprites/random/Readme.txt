This is a Zipped file of sprites that I created for a game that was to be a top down Tank shooter.
The tanks were supposed to be customizable, so turret, chassis, and gun images were split to allow 
them to be intercahnged. We (Sir Sapo and I) decided that we both lacked the enthusiasm to continue, 
so we don't need these anymore,but certain people seemed to express enough interest to merit 
this package, which contains:

"Split+Masked" Folder

	8 Gun Images (with Masks)
	6 Turret Images (with Masks)
	6 Chassis Images (yes, with Masks)

"Mismatched Terrain" Folder
	Waaayy too lazy to explain it, look for yourself
	Grass differs from Image to Image because I kept 
	messing with it in the Gimp. There's some bushes and roads, too

Loose in the Folder
	4 custom tanks (not split up or masked)

Most images are Bitmaps, some are PNG's, all were done in MSpaint, with some blending with the Gimp.

Feel Free to use these for whatever you want, but It'd be nice if I got some credit, Like 
"Sub co-associate pissant artist Mark Simpson". If you actually use them in something, PM me on 
gamedev, I'd like to see it. If you have any questions, again, message me using GameDev (Prinz Eugn)
