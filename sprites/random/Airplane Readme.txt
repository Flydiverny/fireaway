Hello, this is the readme for this here folder of free airplane sprites 
originally intended for our game Angels 20 or another 2D airplane shooter. 
Angels 20 was completed, and sits in the GD Showcase under Sir Sapo's name,
but I was the artist.

The Sprites Themselves consist mostly of various real aircraft drawn from 
the side, with a few I made up. There are a couple top views of the fictional
airplanes, in there, too. Most of the sprites are 128 by 128 in PNG format 
and completed, but a few are either really old(re: bad) or unfinished. 

The only conditions I'd like to apply to their use are these:
1. Notify me if you use them, through Gamedev's PM system, preferably
2. Give me a little credit, include my name in there somewhere(which is:)
